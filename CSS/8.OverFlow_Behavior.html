    <h1>Overflow Handling Demonstration</h1>

    <h2>1. Overflow: Visible</h2>
    <div class="box" id="visible-box">
        Bangladesh, located on the delta of the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Meghna rivers,
        is relatively less prone to frequent earthquakes compared to some neighboring countries. 
        However, it is still vulnerable due to its proximity to the active Himalayan seismic belt.
        Historical records show occasional moderate earthquakes, especially in the northeastern and southeastern regions. 
        Earthquake preparedness is limited, and the high population density in urban areas like Dhaka.
    </div>

    <h2>2. Overflow: Hidden</h2>
    <div class="box" id="hidden-box">
       India is highly susceptible to earthquakes because it lies on the boundary of the Indian Plate and the Eurasian Plate. 
       Northern India, especially states like Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, and Uttarakhand, 
       experiences frequent seismic activity due to the Himalayan collision zone. T
       he eastern and northeastern states, including Assam and Sikkim, are also highly vulnerable. 
       Earthquakes in India have historically caused massive damage to infrastructure and loss of life, 
       highlighting the need for strong disaster management systems.
    </div>

    <h2>3. Overflow: Scroll</h2>
    <div class="box" id="scroll-box">
      Pakistan is situated in a seismically active region because of the collision between the Indian Plate and 
      the Eurasian Plate. Areas such as Balochistan and northern Pakistan, including the regions near Islamabad 
      and Kashmir, are especially prone to earthquakes. Major earthquakes in Pakistan's history, like the 2005 Kashmir earthquake,
     have caused thousands of deaths and extensive destruction. Urban planning and infrastructure development are critical in reducing the risks associated with seismic events.
    </div>

    <h2>4. Overflow: Auto</h2>
    <div class="box" id="auto-box">
       Japan is one of the most earthquake-prone countries in the world due to its location on the Pacific 
       Ring of Fire, where multiple tectonic plates meet. The country experiences frequent tremors,
       from minor earthquakes to massive ones like the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami. Japan has developed advanced 
       earthquake-resistant infrastructure, early warning systems, and strict building codes to minimize casualties and damage. The nation
        serves as a global example of how preparedness and technology can reduce the impact of natural disasters.
